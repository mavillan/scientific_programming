    "## 1.- About Parallelism in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Concurrency:__ Concurrency is concerned with managing access to shared state from different threads.\n",
    "2. __Parallelism:__  Parallelism is concerned with utilizing multiple processors/cores to improve the performance of a computation.\n",
    "3. __Process:__  __A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.__  A process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently.\n",
    "4. __Threads:__ A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threads vs Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing you need to know to understand the difference between a process and a thread, is a fact, __that processes do not run, threads do.__\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Process__:\n",
    "Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identifier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Thread__:\n",
    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. All threads of a process share its virtual address space and system resources. In addition, each thread maintains exception handlers, a scheduling priority, thread local storage, a unique thread identifier, and a set of structures the system will use to save the thread context until it is scheduled. The thread context includes the thread's set of machine registers, the kernel stack, a thread environment block, and a user stack in the address space of the thread's process. Threads can also have their own security context, which can be used for impersonating clients.\n",

    "### Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "__From Python Documentation__: _In CPython, the global interpreter lock, or GIL, is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe. (However, since the GIL exists, other features have grown to depend on the guarantees that it enforces.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "The GIL is controversial because it __prevents multithreaded CPython programs from taking full advantage of multiprocessor systems__ in certain situations. Note that potentially blocking or long-running operations, such as I/O, image processing, and NumPy number crunching, __happen outside the GIL__. Therefore it is only in multithreaded programs that spend a lot of time inside the GIL, interpreting CPython bytecode, that the GIL becomes a bottleneck."
